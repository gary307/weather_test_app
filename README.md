##london weather app

to begin run yarn or npm install

you can run with node using 'npm run server' or 'yarn run server'. Project will run locally on port localhost:3003

To build run 'npm or yarn run build'

The project uses javascript to populate a table based on the city value. You can update this with the input box. Currently the weather reporter only works for countrys in the uk but with more time could extend it to work with rest of the world.

project uses webpack with babel and postcss to bundle the project. I have setup he project to run on a express server serving up the static dist folder.
